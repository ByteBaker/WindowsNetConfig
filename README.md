# WindowsNetConfig

The program is based on batch. Essentially limiting it to Windows OS only.

I created this software when my friends were playing Counter Strike over LAN, but getting different network addresses. Due to this, they could not connect their PCs to play.

Assigning static IP addresses was a (slightly) time consuming job, which involved many clicks and keypresses.

So I made this program to reduce all the hassle to one single step.

## What this program does? 
Right now the program can do two things:
  1. Disable DHCP and assign a static IP address to the computer.
  2. Enable DHCP again.
#### It has to be noted that the software works on "Ethernet" interface only.

### The program's effect is visible only if there is an active RJ45 plugged into the PC.
